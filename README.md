# Haiiiiiuuuu :3

I'm Chaleon, currently reading MSc Stats (Biostats) at ICL after doing my Math & Stats undergrad in ICL. Here you'll find my _gradual descent into insanity_.

To recover my sanity, I often turn back to my notes or engage in a few hobbies:
1. Bridge
2. Mahjong (Riichi)
3. Specific musical numbers

My goal is to make the world and society happier, here's a [star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
